# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-Modifier-Integration
The Sentiment Analysis Modifier Integration analyzes the sentiment of incoming messages in a Telex channel using NLP APIs. It detects whether messages are positive, negative, or neutral and flags or modifies toxic content before it appears in the channel. If a message contains hate speech, threats, or offensive language, it can be replaced with a warning or blocked entirely.
